# Navigation Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

The navigation between `shopping-welcome.html` and `shopping-lists.html` was broken due to a localStorage key mismatch, causing an infinite redirect loop back to the welcome page.

## Root Cause

**Issue Location:** `src/pages/shopping-welcome.html` line 172

### The Problem
- `shopping-welcome.html` was saving user data with key: `'userData'`
- `shopping-lists.html` and `create-shopping-list.html` were looking for key: `'bargainly_user'`

This mismatch caused:
1. User fills form on welcome page
2. Data saved to localStorage with wrong key
3. User navigates to shopping-lists.html
4. shopping-lists.html can't find data with correct key
5. Page redirects back to welcome page
6. Infinite loop

## Solution

Changed the localStorage key in `shopping-welcome.html` from `'userData'` to `'bargainly_user'` to match the key used in other pages.

### Code Change

**Before:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(userData));
```

**After:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('bargainly_user', JSON.stringify(userData));
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Results

✅ **Test 1: Form Submission Navigation**
- Filled form with user data
- Clicked "Começar Agora" button
- Successfully navigated to shopping-lists.html
- User name displayed correctly in navigation
- Data persisted in localStorage with correct key

✅ **Test 2: Skip Button Navigation**
- Clicked "Pular por Agora" button
- Random user data generated
- Successfully navigated to shopping-lists.html
- Random name displayed correctly
- Data saved with `skipped: true` flag

✅ **Test 3: Page Persistence**
- With user data present
- Navigated directly to shopping-lists.html
- Page loaded correctly without redirect
- User data displayed properly

✅ **Test 4: Redirect Without Data**
- Without user data in localStorage
- Attempted to navigate to shopping-lists.html
- Successfully redirected to shopping-welcome.html

### Automated E2E Tests

Created comprehensive Playwright test suite in `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.js`:

1. **Form submission flow** - Validates full form submission and navigation
2. **Skip button flow** - Tests quick onboarding with random data
3. **Data persistence** - Ensures page stays loaded with valid data
4. **Redirect logic** - Verifies redirect when no user data exists
5. **Cross-page navigation** - Tests navigation to create-shopping-list page
6. **Create page protection** - Validates redirect from create page without data

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

![Shopping Lists - Form Submit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c32b6e1-baec-47ed-9644-6fc91bba2b64)
- User name "Test User Manual" displayed in navigation
- Navigation successful
- No redirect loop

### 4. Shopping Lists Page (After Skip Button)
![Shopping Lists - Skip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea5730dd-6f47-40c1-9dec-780237f1fb44)
- Random name "João Santos" displayed
- Navigation successful
- No redirect loop

## Impact

### Fixed Flows
1. ✅ Welcome → Shopping Lists (via form submission)
2. ✅ Welcome → Shopping Lists (via skip button)
3. ✅ Shopping Lists page persistence with valid data
4. ✅ Create Shopping List page protection

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a pure bug fix with no breaking changes.

### Migration
No migration needed. Users who had data stored with the old `'userData'` key will need to go through the welcome flow again, which is acceptable for this early stage of the application.

2. Add TypeScript for better type safety
3. Implement proper authentication with backend
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Consider using a state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
