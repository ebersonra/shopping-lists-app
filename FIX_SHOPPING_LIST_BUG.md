# Fix Summary: ShoppingList is not defined Error

## Issue Description

When attempting to create a shopping list via the `/create-shopping-list.html` page, the API returned a 400 error with the message:

```
Error: ShoppingList is not defined
```

### Original Error Details

**Console Error:**

```
POST https://deploy-preview-17--supermarket-lists.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/create-shopping-list 400 (Bad Request)
Error saving list: Error: ShoppingList is not defined
    at HTMLFormElement.saveList (create-shopping-list.html:1191:27)
```

**API Response:**

```json
{ "error": "ShoppingList is not defined" }
```

**Request Payload:**

```json
{
  "user_id": "9eb946b7-7e29-4460-a9cf-81aebac2ea4c",
  "title": "Teste Super",
  "description": "Teste",
  "shopping_date": "2025-10-16",
  "market_id": "1",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_name": "Sal",
      "category": "Mercearia",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit": "un",
      "unit_price": 5,
      "total_price": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Root Cause

The `shoppingListController.js` file was attempting to use the `ShoppingList` and `ShoppingListItem` model classes (lines 34 and 50) to validate request data, but these models were not imported. The import statement was commented out as a TODO:

```javascript
// TODO: Create models folder and define ShoppingList and ShoppingListItem models
// const { ShoppingList, ShoppingListItem } = require('../models');
```

However, the models **did exist** in `src/models/ShoppingList.js` but were simply not imported in the controller.

## Solution

### Code Changes

**File: `src/controllers/shoppingListController.js`**

Changed from:

```javascript
const service = require('../services/shoppingListService');
// TODO: Create models folder and define ShoppingList and ShoppingListItem models
// const { ShoppingList, ShoppingListItem } = require('../models');
```

To:

```javascript
const service = require('../services/shoppingListService');
const { ShoppingList, ShoppingListItem } = require('../models/ShoppingList');
```

This single-line change fixes the issue by properly importing the model classes that the controller was trying to use.

## Testing

### Test Coverage Added

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/shoppingListController.test.js`): 9 comprehensive tests
   - Validates ShoppingList model instantiation and validation
   - Tests all required field validations (user_id, title, shopping_date)
   - Tests item validation (product_name, category, unit)
   - Tests handling of multiple items
   - Tests various validation error scenarios

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/create-shopping-list-integration.test.js`): 4 tests
   - Specifically validates that "ShoppingList is not defined" error no longer occurs
   - Tests model validation is working correctly
   - Tests item field validation using models
   - Tests HTTP method validation

3. **E2E Test** (`tests/e2e/create-shopping-list.spec.js`): 1 additional test
   - Monitors console and API responses for "ShoppingList is not defined" error
   - Tests complete flow with form submission

### Test Results

All 56 unit tests pass:

```
# tests 56
# suites 0
# pass 56
# fail 0
```

### Manual Verification

Tested the exact payload from the bug report:

```javascript
✅ PASSED: Bug is fixed!
Status: 400
Error: Supabase credentials are required... (expected in test env)
// Previously would have been: "ShoppingList is not defined"
```

Tested model validation:

```javascript
✅ PASSED: Model validation working!
Error: List validation failed: Title is required
```

## Impact

- **Before Fix**: API returned 400 error with "ShoppingList is not defined"
- **After Fix**: API properly validates input using ShoppingList models and returns meaningful validation errors

## Files Modified

1. `src/controllers/shoppingListController.js` - Added model import (1 line changed)
2. `tests/shoppingListController.test.js` - New unit tests (195 lines)
3. `tests/create-shopping-list-integration.test.js` - New integration tests (113 lines)
4. `tests/e2e/create-shopping-list.spec.js` - Added E2E test case (65 lines)

## Verification Steps

To verify this fix in a live environment:

1. Navigate to `/create-shopping-list.html`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Teste Super"
   - Description: "Teste"
   - Shopping Date: Future date
   - Add an item (e.g., Sal, Mercearia, 1 un, R$ 5.00)
3. Submit the form
4. Verify the API does NOT return "ShoppingList is not defined" error
5. The list should be created successfully (assuming Supabase credentials are configured)
